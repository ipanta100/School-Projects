Othello/Reversi app 

Human vs Human / Human vs Computer / Computer vs Computer Application

The objective of this project is to produce a system for managing Othello/Reversi games.
Players can be either humans or computers. Participants must be registered in order to play.
To register, one enters a screen name of five letters and digits; and a password of five digits.
To play a game, participants must first log in and make a request to play.
The game will start when two players have signed up to play.

The System Administrator must log in as administrator. 
(S)he will have the ability to set certain parameters, including time limits.

The system will keep records of wins and losses of players.
Guests can view records of wins/losses of individual games or players.

This was a collaborate project with my classmates over the course of the semester.
Although we were not able to work out all the bugs, we accomplished as much as possible within the time frame.
